Dr. Oakley encourages her students to recognize that people have different learning styles. Some individuals have "racecar brains," quickly absorbing information, while others possess "hiker brains," taking more time to assimilate information but gaining a deeper understanding by perceiving finer details along the way.

### What are active and diffused modes of thinking?

Focused Thinking (Active Mode): This is a concentrated and effortful mode of thinking where you are deeply engaged with a specific task or problem. It's characterized by intense focus and is often used when learning something new or solving complex problems.

Diffuse Thinking (Diffused Mode): This mode is more relaxed and allows your mind to wander freely. It's a state where you are not actively focused on a specific task. Diffuse thinking is often associated with creativity, making connections between ideas, and gaining insights. It's also a valuable mode for learning and understanding complex concepts, as it allows your brain to process information in the background.
